  **Design Movement**: **New Academic Classicism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Intellectual Gravity**: The design should feel substantial and serious, reflecting the weight of ethical inquiry.
  2. **Clarity of Thought**: Layouts should be structured and logical, mirroring philosophical argumentation.
  3. **Institutional Heritage**: Honoring Princeton's history while presenting a forward-looking perspective.
  4. **Dialogical Space**: Visual cues should suggest conversation, debate, and the exchange of ideas.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Princeton Orange (#E87722)**: Used sparingly as a "spark" of insight or call to action, representing the energy of intellectual discovery.
  - **Deep Charcoal/Black (#121212)**: Represents the depth of ethical questions and provides a strong contrast.
  - **Warm Off-White/Cream (#F8F5F2)**: Evokes the feeling of paper and books, softening the digital experience.
  - **Slate Blue (#4A5D75)**: A secondary tone to balance the warmth, suggesting calm rationality.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Editorial**: Moving away from standard centered grids to a more magazine-like editorial layout.
  - **Sidebar Navigation**: A persistent left or right rail for navigation, reminiscent of marginalia in texts.
  - **Split-Screen Hero**: Juxtaposing a powerful image (The Thinker) with a provocative ethical question.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Serif Typography**: Prominent use of a high-contrast serif for headings to evoke tradition.
  - **Line Work**: Thin, precise lines separating content sections, referencing the structure of logic.
  - **The "Thinker" Motif**: Stylized, perhaps abstract or sketched versions of the logo used as background watermarks.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Deliberate Hover States**: Interactions should be smooth and slightly slower than average, encouraging pause and reflection.
  - **Reading Focus**: "Focus mode" for articles where distractions fade away.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade and Slide**: Elements enter with a gentle upward slide and fade, like thoughts emerging.
  - **Parallax Scrolling**: Subtle depth between text and background elements.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* or *Merriweather* (Serif) - Elegant, authoritative.
  - **Body**: *Inter* or *Source Sans Pro* (Sans-serif) - Clean, highly readable for dense text.
  - **Accents**: *JetBrains Mono* or similar monospaced font for dates/metadata, suggesting data or footnotes.

  **Design Movement**: **Modern Ivy League Minimalist**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Accessible Prestige**: High-end academic feel but welcoming to undergraduates.
  2. **Vibrant Inquiry**: Using color to show that ethics is alive and relevant, not dusty.
  3. **Community Focused**: Highlighting the people (students, speakers) behind the ideas.
  4. **Action Oriented**: Ethics as a practice, not just theory.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Vibrant Princeton Orange (#F58025)**: Used boldly for backgrounds and major accents to create energy.
  - **Pure White (#FFFFFF)**: For maximum clarity and modern feel.
  - **Cool Gray (#F0F2F5)**: For section backgrounds to create subtle separation.
  - **Deep Navy (#001F3F)**: As a grounding dark color instead of pure black.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Card-Based Masonry**: Flexible grid of cards for events, articles, and profiles, reflecting a dynamic community.
  - **Large Hero Typography**: Oversized sans-serif text for impact statements.
  - **Sticky Header**: Traditional top navigation for familiarity and ease of access.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Rounded Corners**: Softening the edges to feel more approachable (border-radius: 0.75rem).
  - **Drop Shadows**: Soft, diffused shadows to create depth and lift content off the page.
  - **Photography First**: Large, high-quality images of students engaging in discussion.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snappy Feedback**: Buttons and cards react instantly to hover with scale or color changes.
  - **Micro-interactions**: subtle animations on icons and buttons.

  **Animation**:
  - **Staggered Reveal**: Content cards load in a staggered sequence.
  - **Scale on Hover**: Interactive elements grow slightly to invite clicking.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Montserrat* or *Poppins* (Geometric Sans) - Modern, bold, friendly.
  - **Body**: *Open Sans* or *Lato* - Neutral, legible.
  - **Quotes**: *Lora* (Serif) - For pulling out key ethical questions or quotes.

  **Design Movement**: **Ethical Brutalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Honesty**: Exposing the structure of the site, symbolizing the search for truth.
  2. **High Contrast**: Stark differences between light and dark to represent ethical dilemmas.
  3. **Function over Form**: Prioritizing the content (text) above decoration.
  4. **Urgency**: A design that feels immediate and important.
